## Introduction

The "Hello, World!" program is a time-honored tradition in programming. It's a simple program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the screen. Writing this program is often the first step for beginners learning a new programming language, including C.

## Getting Started

To get started with this program, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install a C Compiler**: Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system. A popular choice is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

2. **Create a C Source File**: Use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to create a new C source file, for example, `hello.c`.

3. **Write the "Hello, World!" Code**: Open the `hello.c` file and add the following code:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
       return 0;
   }
This code includes the standard input/output library (<stdio.h>) and defines a main function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

How to Compile and Run
After writing the "Hello, World!" code, you need to compile and run it. Follow these steps:

Compile the Code: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where hello.c is located. Use the following command to compile the code:
```bash
gcc -o hello hello.c
```
This command tells GCC to compile hello.c and generate an executable named hello.

Run the Program: Once the compilation is successful, you can run the program by typing:
```bash
./hello
```
You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed on your terminal.
