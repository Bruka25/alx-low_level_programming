The following projects contain c programs for ALX 0x08-recursion:

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.

In the this project the following recursive functions are included:

* A function that prints a string, followed by a new line
* A fucntion that prints a string in reverse
* A fuction that returns the length of a string
* A function that returns the factorial of a given number
* A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y
* A function that returns the natural square root of a number
* A function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0
* A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not
* A function  that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0
