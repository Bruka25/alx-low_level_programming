The following C programs are for ALX 0x0F-function_pointers assignment, inside it contains the following c functions and programs:

* A function that prints a name
* A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array
* A function that searches for an integer
* A program that performs simple operations
* A a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function

Introduction to C Functions
Functions in C allow the modularization of code by breaking it into smaller, manageable units. They promote code reusability and readability by encapsulating specific tasks or computations.

Understanding Pointers in C
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses as their values. They are crucial in dynamic memory allocation, passing by reference, and manipulating memory directly.

Repository Setup
To start working with C functions and pointers:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-low_level_programming
cd 0x0F-function_pointers
```
Navigate to the Directory: Enter the directory containing the source code.

Compilation Process
For compiling C code containing functions and pointers:

Compile the Code: Use a C compiler to compile the source code containing functions and pointers. For example:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 source_code.c -o output_executable
```
Run the Executable: Execute the compiled code using:

```
./output_executable
```
Examples
Example 1: C Functions
```
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int result = add(5, 3);
printf("Result: %d\n", result);
```

```
Example 2: Pointers Usage
c
Copy code
int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num;

printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr); // Output: 10
```
Conclusion
Functions and pointers are integral parts of C programming, enabling code modularity, reusability, and efficient memory management. Understanding their usage is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable C code.
