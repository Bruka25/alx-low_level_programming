## Introduction

Pointers and arrays are essential features of C programming. Pointers allow you to work with memory addresses directly, while arrays provide a structured way to store and manipulate data. This project aims to provide a practical understanding of how to use them effectively.

## Project Structure

This project's structure is organized as follows:

- **main.c**: Contains the main program logic.
- **pointers.c**: Demonstrates pointer concepts.
- **arrays.c**: Covers array operations.
- **Makefile**: Simplifies compilation and project management.

## Pointers

### Working with Pointers

In C, you can declare and manipulate pointers like this:

```c
int main() {
    int x = 42;
    int *ptr = &x; // Declare a pointer and assign the address of 'x' to it

    // Dereference the pointer to access the value at the memory address
    printf("Value of x: %d\n", *ptr);

    return 0;
}

Arrays
Array Declaration and Usage
Arrays in C allow you to store multiple elements of the same data type:

```c
int main() {
    int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Element %d: %d\n", i, numbers[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
