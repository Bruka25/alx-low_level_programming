## Introduction

In programming, functions allow you to encapsulate logic into reusable blocks, while nested loops help you perform repetitive tasks more efficiently. This project provides practical examples to help you understand these concepts better.

## Project Structure

This project's structure is straightforward:

- **main.c**: Contains the main program logic.
- **functions.c**: Includes custom functions.
- **functions.h**: Declares function prototypes.
- **Makefile**: Simplifies compilation and project management.

## Functions

### Function Declaration and Implementation

In C, you declare and implement functions as follows:

```c
// functions.h
#ifndef FUNCTIONS_H
#define FUNCTIONS_H

// Function prototype
int add(int a, int b);

#endif

```c
// functions.c
#include "functions.h"

// Function implementation
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "functions.h"

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 7);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```
Nested Loops
Working with Nested Loops
Nested loops are used to perform repeated operations within other loops. Here's a simple example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
            printf("(%d, %d) ", i, j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
