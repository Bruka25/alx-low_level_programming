What is the C Preprocessor?
The C preprocessor is a tool that processes the source code before compilation, performing tasks such as macro substitution, conditional compilation, and file inclusion. It enhances code maintainability and flexibility.

Repository Setup
To start using the C preprocessor:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-low_level_programming
cd 0x0D-preprocessor
```
Navigate to the Directory: Enter the directory containing the source code.

Compilation Process
To compile the C code using the preprocessor:

Run Preprocessing: Use the compiler with the -E flag to run the preprocessor and generate the preprocessed output. For example:

mathematica
Copy code
gcc -E source_code.c -o preprocessed_output.i
Compile Preprocessed Code: Compile the preprocessed output to create the executable file using the compiler. For example:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 preprocessed_output.i -o output_executable
```
File Compilation
For file inclusion and compilation:

Include Files: Use #include directives to include necessary headers or external files in your source code.
Compilation: Compile the code containing the included files using the compilation process mentioned above.
Examples
Example 1: Macros

```
#define PI 3.14159
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

float area = PI * SQUARE(radius);

```
Example 2: Conditional Compilation
```
#define DEBUG_MODE 1

#if DEBUG_MODE
    // Debugging code
#else
    // Release code
#endif
```

Example 3: File Inclusion
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "my_library.h"
```
Conclusion
The C preprocessor is an essential tool for C programming, allowing for code organization, macro definition, and conditional compilation. Understanding its functionalities and integration with compilation processes is crucial for effective software development.

This README.md file serves as a comprehensive guide to using the C preprocessor, including repository setup, the compilation process, file inclusion, and examples. You can further customize this document to suit specific project requirements or include additional details as needed.

The following programs are for ALX 0x0D-preprocessor project, inside this project it contains the following header files and functions:

* A header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024
* A header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359
* A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line
* A function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x
* A function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y
