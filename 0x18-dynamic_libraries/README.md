The following programs are for ALX 0x18-dynamic_libraries project, inside it contains the following dynamic libraries and bash scripts:

* A dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:
```
int _putchar(char c);
int _islower(int c);
int _isalpha(int c);
int _abs(int n);
int _isupper(int c);
int _isdigit(int c);
int _strlen(char *s);
void _puts(char *s);
char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
int _atoi(char *s);
char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
```
* A script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory
* A dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python
* A code injection with Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?, and with the below documentation
```
/* Giga Millions program                                                                                    
  * Players may pick six numbers from two separate pools of numbers:                                                
  * - five different numbers from 1 to 75 and                                                                       
  * - one number from 1 to 15                                                                                       
  * You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.                                           
  * Your chances to win the jackpot is 1 in 258,890,850

  * usage: ./gm n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 bonus
