The following programs are for ALX 0x1A-hash_tables project for the low level programming language curriculum, inside it contains the following C functions:

* A function that creates a hash table
* A hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm
* A function that gives you the index of a key
* A function that adds an element to the hash table
* A function that retrieves a value associated with a key
* A function that prints a hash table
* A function that deletes a hash table
* In PHP, hash tables are ordered. Waitâ€¦ WAT? How is this even possible?
* Rewrite the previous functions using these data structures:

       -> shash_table_t *shash_table_create(unsigned long int size);
       -> int shash_table_set(shash_table_t *ht, const char *key, const char *value);
       -> The key/value pair should be inserted in the sorted list at the right place
       -> Note that here we do not want to do exactly like PHP: we want to create a sorted linked list, by key (sorted on ASCII value), 
          that we can print by traversing it. See example.
       -> char *shash_table_get(const shash_table_t *ht, const char *key);
          void shash_table_print(const shash_table_t *ht);
       -> Should print the hash table using the sorted linked list
          void shash_table_print_rev(const shash_table_t *ht);
       ->Should print the hash tables key/value pairs in reverse order using the sorted linked list
          void shash_table_delete(shash_table_t *ht);
