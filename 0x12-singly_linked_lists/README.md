The following C files are for ALX 0x12-singly_linked_lists project, inside it contains the following C files:

* A function that prints all the elements of a list_t list
* A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list
* A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list
* A function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list
* A function that frees a list_t list
* A function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed
* Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line

C Singly Linked List Guide
Overview
This guide introduces singly linked lists in C programming, explaining their structure, operations, and implementation. Understanding singly linked lists is essential for managing dynamic data structures efficiently.

Introduction to Singly Linked Lists
A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list. Singly linked lists facilitate dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

Basic Operations on Singly Linked Lists
1. Insertion
At the Beginning: Add a node at the beginning of the list.
At the End: Append a node at the end of the list.
At a Specific Position: Insert a node at a specified position in the list.
2. Deletion
From the Beginning: Remove a node from the beginning of the list.
From the End: Delete the last node from the list.
From a Specific Position: Remove a node from a specified position in the list.
3. Traversal and Display
Traverse the list and display its elements.
Repository Setup
To start working with a singly linked list in C:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-low_level_programming
cd 0x12-singly_linked_lists
```
Navigate to the Directory: Enter the directory containing the source code.

Compilation Process
For compiling C code containing a singly linked list:

Compile the Code: Use a C compiler to compile the source code containing the singly linked list implementation. For example:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 source_code.c -o output_executable
```
Run the Executable: Execute the compiled code using:

```
./output_executable
```
Examples
Example 1: Singly Linked List Creation and Traversal

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

// Functions for operations on singly linked list (insertion, deletion, display, etc.)
// ...

int main() {
    // Create a singly linked list
    // Perform operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.)
    // Display the list
    return 0;
}
```
Example 2: Singly Linked List Operations

```
// Implement functions for various operations on the singly linked list
// Example: Insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.
```
Conclusion
Singly linked lists are fundamental data structures in C programming, offering dynamic memory allocation and efficient manipulation of elements. Understanding their implementation and operations is crucial for managing data effectively.

This README.md file serves as a guide to understanding and implementing a singly linked list in C, including its structure, basic operations, setup, compilation processes, and example code snippets. Customize or expand upon this document to suit your project's specific needs.
