Memory Allocation in C using malloc and free
This project aims to demonstrate the usage of malloc and free functions in the C programming language for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

About
Dynamic memory allocation is a crucial aspect of programming where memory is allocated at runtime. The malloc function in C (short for memory allocation) is used to allocate a specified number of bytes from the heap memory, while free is used to deallocate or release previously allocated memory.

Features
Malloc: Demonstrates how to allocate memory dynamically using malloc.
Free: Illustrates the proper usage of free to release allocated memory and prevent memory leaks.
Example Programs: Provides sample C programs showcasing the usage of malloc and free.
Installation
This project consists of C source code files that can be compiled using a C compiler like GCC.

Clone the Repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-low_level_programming
$ cd 0x0C-more_malloc_free
```

Compile the Programs:
```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o malloc_example malloc_example.c
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o free_example free_example.c
```

Malloc Example
Run the malloc_example program to see how memory can be allocated dynamically:

```
$ ./malloc_example
This program will demonstrate allocating memory for specific data types or arrays.
```
Free Example
Execute the free_example program to understand the proper use of free to deallocate memory:

```
$ ./free_example
```

This program will show how to release the dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
