## Introduction

In software engineering, building modular and reusable code is crucial. This project focuses on two fundamental concepts: functions and nested loops in the C programming language. By mastering these, you'll be better equipped to create structured and efficient software.

## Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

- **main.c**: Contains the main program logic.
- **functions.c**: Includes custom functions.
- **functions.h**: Declares function prototypes.
- **Makefile**: Helps with compilation and project management.

## Functions in C

### Creating Functions

Functions in C allow you to break your code into smaller, manageable parts. Here's how you can define and use functions:

```c
// functions.h
#ifndef FUNCTIONS_H
#define FUNCTIONS_H

// Function prototype
int add(int a, int b);

#endif

```c
// functions.c
#include "functions.h"

// Function implementation
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "functions.h"

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 7);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```
Nested Loops
Nested loops are used for performing repetitive tasks. They are often encountered in software engineering projects. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rows = 3, cols = 4;

    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
