The following functions are C programs for ALX 0x15-file_io project, inside it contains the following C functions:

* A function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output
* A function that creates a file
* A function that appends text at the end of a file
* A program that copies the content of a file to another file
* A program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file

C File Input/Output (I/O) Guide
Overview
This guide introduces File Input/Output (I/O) operations in C programming, demonstrating file handling, reading, writing, and manipulation. Understanding file I/O is essential for interacting with files, performing data input/output, and managing file-related operations in C.

Introduction to File I/O
File Input/Output (I/O) in C involves operations for reading data from files, writing data to files, and managing file pointers. It includes opening, closing, reading, and writing to files using standard library functions.

File Modes in C
1. Read ("r"), Write ("w"), Append ("a") Modes
Read ("r"): Opens a file for reading. The file must exist; otherwise, fopen returns NULL.
Write ("w"): Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates it; if it doesn't, a new file is created.
Append ("a"): Opens a file for writing at the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.
2. Read-Write ("r+"), Write-Read ("w+") Modes
Read-Write ("r+"): Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file must exist.
Write-Read ("w+"): Opens a file for reading and writing. If the file exists, it truncates it; if it doesn't, a new file is created.
Basic File Operations
1. Opening a File
Use fopen() to open a file with the specified mode.

2. Reading from a File
Use fscanf() or fgets() to read data from a file.

3. Writing to a File
Use fprintf() or fputs() to write data to a file.

4. Closing a File
Use fclose() to close the file after performing operations.

Repository Setup
To start working with File I/O in C:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-low_level_programming
cd 0x15-file_io
```
Navigate to the Directory: Enter the directory containing the source code.

Compilation Process
For compiling C code containing File I/O operations:

Compile the Code: Use a C compiler to compile the source code containing file operations. For example:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 source_code.c -o output_executable
```
Run the Executable: Execute the compiled code using:

```
./output_executable
```
Examples
Example 1: Reading from a File

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("input.txt", "r");
    if (file != NULL) {
        // Read and process file content
        // fclose(file) when done
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Example 2: Writing to a File

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("output.txt", "w");
    if (file != NULL) {
        // Write data to the file
        // fclose(file) when done
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Conclusion
File Input/Output operations in C are fundamental for handling file-related tasks such as reading, writing, and manipulating data in files. Mastering file I/O is essential for file management and data handling in C programming.
